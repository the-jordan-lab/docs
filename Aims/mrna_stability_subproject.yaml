notes: |
  This subproject aims to determine if Ybx1 knockdown influences the stability of mRNAs, 
  particularly those with known or suspected post-transcriptional modifications (m5C or m6A). 
  
  Specific aims:
  1. Establish efficient Ybx1 knockdown using siRNA
  2. Measure half-lives of selected target mRNAs in control vs. Ybx1 knockdown conditions
  3. Identify genes most affected by Ybx1 depletion
  4. Correlate mRNA stability changes with RNA modifications if possible
  
  Initial target genes include Myc, p53, and other transcripts with known post-transcriptional regulation.
  
  This experiment will employ actinomycin D to block transcription, followed by time-course 
  sampling and RT-qPCR to measure the decay rates of specific mRNAs.
