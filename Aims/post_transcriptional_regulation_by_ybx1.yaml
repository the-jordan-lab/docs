title: Post-transcriptional regulation by Ybx1
description: Project to understand how Ybx1 influences post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, with emphasis on mRNA stability
date_started: 2025-05-06
lead: Dr. Jim Jordan
team_members:
  - Dr. Jim Jordan
  - Jack Zhao
associated_protocols:
  - siRNA transfection protocol
  - Actinomycin D mRNA stability protocol
experiments:
  - TBD
notes: |
  This project will investigate the role of Ybx1 in regulating mRNA stability, 
  with particular focus on genes involved in cellular processes. Ybx1 has been 
  shown to interact with m5C and m6A modifications on mRNAs, suggesting a role 
  in post-transcriptional gene regulation.
