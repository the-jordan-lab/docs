# Data Folder

This folder stores data outputs or references to data generated by experiments.

## How to Add Data
- Organize data by experiment or project, e.g., `Data/Images/EXP-0002/` for images from experiment 0002.
- For large data, store externally and add a pointer (URL or path) in the experiment YAML.
- For small data, add files directly to the appropriate subfolder.
- Update the relevant experiment YAML to reference the data files or links.

## Best Practices
- Keep data organized and clearly linked to experiments/projects.
- Do not store sensitive or very large files directly in the repository; use external storage and reference them.
