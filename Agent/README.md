# Agent Folder

This folder contains the code for the AI agent integration and task-runner.

- `agent_runner.py`: Main Python script for executing agent-driven actions.
- `__init__.py`: Marks this directory as a Python package.

## Purpose
- Implements the logic for handling function calls from the agent (e.g., creating protocols, experiments, updating records, etc.).
- Handles integration with GitHub, smart-fill, and other automation features.

## How to Use
- The agent/task-runner is started automatically in the Codespace, or can be run manually with `python Agent/agent_runner.py`.
