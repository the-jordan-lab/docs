# Histidine Interface Visualization Work Log

## Session: May 5, 2023

### Adaptation for Interactive Use

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Reviewed `his-interface-visualization.py` script
   - Identified core visualization functions

2. **Helper Module Creation**
   - Created `his_viz_single.py` module with simplified functions
   - Extracted key functions from main script:
     - `visualize_pdb()` and `visualize_cif()` for processing individual files
     - Added helper functions for listing files and processing by index/name

3. **Jupyter Notebook Setup**
   - Created `ndufs7_vis_notebook.ipynb` for interactive use
   - Set up cells for:
     - Package installation
     - File listing from `ndufs-7-acot-9-mm-af2-models` directory
     - Single file processing with index selection
     - Optional batch processing

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Identified need for jupyter installation:
     ```
     pip install jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Ensured dependencies (py3Dmol, biopython) were specified

### Expected Workflow

The interactive workflow allows:

1. Listing all available PDB/CIF files in the NDUFS7-ACOT9 folder
2. Processing files one at a time by changing the `file_index` parameter
3. Viewing generated HTML visualizations with interactive 3D models
4. Optionally processing files by name or full path

### Notes

- Created an output directory for HTML files
- Each visualization shows two views:
  1. Surface + Ribbon (no labels)
  2. Surface only + labeled histidine interactions
- Interactive features include rotation, zoom, and PNG export
