# TASKS

_Note: This file is now automatically updated by the agent/task-runner. Tasks are marked done when experiments are completed, and new tasks may be added as needed._

## Lab Tasks
### Ybx1 Knockdown mRNA Stability Experiment (EXP-0225)
- [ ] Day 1 (May 6, 2025): Complete reverse transfection setup
  - [ ] Thaw HEK293T cells and check viability
  - [ ] Prepare transfection master mixes (siRNA targeting Ybx1 and Control siRNA)
  - [ ] Set up reverse transfection in 24-well plates
  - [ ] Update experiment status in repository
- [ ] Day 3 (May 8, 2025): Verify Ybx1 knockdown by qPCR
- [ ] Day 3 (May 8, 2025): Begin actinomycin D time course experiment
  - [ ] Collect t=0 samples before actinomycin D addition
  - [ ] Add actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) to remaining wells
  - [ ] Collect samples at 2h, 4h, and 8h timepoints
- [ ] Day 4 (May 9, 2025): Complete RNA extractions
- [ ] Day 4 (May 9, 2025): Synthesize cDNA and perform qPCR
- [ ] Submit final data to repository and link to experimental record

### Materials and Resources
- [ ] Confirm Actinomycin D stock availability
- [ ] Ensure sufficient RNA extraction reagents are available
- [ ] Check qPCR primer stocks for all target genes

## Development Tasks
- [ ] Reorganize repository structure: convert "projects" to "aims" and "subprojects" to "projects" for better GitHub integration
- [ ] Improve GitHub issue integration with short hash identifiers for future-proofing
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new naming conventions
- [ ] Evaluate need for TASKS.md file in the new structure (consider GitHub issues as primary task tracker)
