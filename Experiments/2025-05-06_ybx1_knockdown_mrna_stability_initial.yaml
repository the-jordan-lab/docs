  Timeline:
  - Day 1 (May 6, 2025): Reverse transfection setup
  - Day 3 (May 8, 2025): Confirm knockdown by qPCR
  - Day 3 (May 8, 2025): Add actinomycin D and collect timepoints
  - Day 4 (May 9, 2025): RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis
  - RNA collection and qPCR analysis for days 3-4 by Jack Zhao
  
  Special considerations:
  - We will use reverse transfection to improve efficiency and reduce handling steps
  - Actinomycin D is toxic; use proper PPE and dispose of waste in designated containers
  - All timepoints after actinomycin D addition should be processed rapidly to minimize RNA degradation
  - Plan to freeze samples at -80°C if all timepoints cannot be processed on the same day
  
  Next steps:
  - May 10, 2025: Data analysis and calculation of mRNA half-lives
  - Based on results, plan follow-up experiments with expanded gene set or modified conditions
