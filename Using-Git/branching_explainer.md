Yes, creating a new branch is a great idea for experimenting with a new feature or concept! This is a perfect use case for branching since it allows you to:

1. Safely experiment without affecting the main codebase
2. Keep your experimental changes isolated
3. Easily switch back to the main branch if needed
4. Create a pull request later if the idea works out

Let me help you create a new branch. First, I'll check the current git status to make sure we're starting from a clean state.



```bash
git status | cat
```
Great! The working tree is clean. Let's create a new branch with a descriptive name. I'll suggest naming it `feature/lab-management-tool` since it's a new feature for lab management functionality.


```bash
git checkout -b feature/lab-management-tool
```
Perfect! You're now on a new branch called `feature/lab-management-tool`. You can start experimenting with your ideas here without affecting the main codebase. 

Some tips for working on this branch:
1. Make regular commits as you develop your ideas
2. If you want to share your work with others, you can push this branch to the remote repository
3. If the idea works out well, you can create a pull request to merge it back into main
4. If you decide the idea isn't working, you can simply switch back to main and delete this branch

Would you like to start implementing your lab management tool ideas? I'd be happy to help you with the implementation!
