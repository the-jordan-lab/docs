id: PROT-0012
name: BSA-OAPA (1:1) Treatment Protocol 2
version: 1.0
description: Protocol for treating cells with BSA-conjugated oleic and palmitic acids (OAPA)
author: JJ

last_updated: 2025-05-07
category: cell-treatment

# Treatment details
treatment:
  type: fatty-acid
  ratio: "1:1 (OA:PA)"
  total_concentration: 0.25 mM
  duration: 48 hours
  control: BSA-only treatment

# Materials required
materials:
  - name: Oleic acid (OA)
    concentration: 0.125 mM
    preparation: BSA-conjugated
  - name: Palmitic acid (PA)
    concentration: 0.125 mM
    preparation: BSA-conjugated
  - name: Complete culture medium
    notes: Use media appropriate for cell type

# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Prepare BSA-conjugated OA and PA mixture"
    details: "Final concentration: 0.125 mM OA, 0.125 mM PA (0.25 mM total, 1:1 ratio)"
  - step: 2
    action: "Treat cells 24h after reverse transfection"
    details: "Ensure cells have properly adhered before treatment"
  - step: 3
    action: "Incubate for 48h with treatment"
    details: "Maintain standard culture conditions during incubation"
  - step: 4
    action: "Use BSA-only treatment as control"
    details: "Ensure BSA concentration matches that used in fatty acid conjugation"

# Experimental context
experimental_notes:
  - condition: "short siRNA"
  - condition: "long treatment (48h)"
  - condition: "low dose 1:1 ratio of OA:PA"
  
# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves and eye protection required"
  hazards: "Avoid direct contact with concentrated fatty acids"
