version: 1.0
description: Protocol for treating cells with BSA-conjugated oleic/palmitic acids and insulin
author: JJ
created: 2025-04-30
last_updated: 2025-05-07
category: cell-treatment

# Treatment details
treatment:
  primary:
    type: fatty-acid
    ratio: "1:1 (OA:PA)"
    total_concentration: 0.5 mM
    duration: 24 hours
  secondary:
    type: hormone
    name: Insulin
    concentration: 100 nM
    duration: 24 hours
  control: 
    - BSA-only treatment
    - Vehicle (no insulin)

# Materials required
materials:
  - name: Oleic acid (OA)
    concentration: 0.25 mM
    preparation: BSA-conjugated
  - name: Palmitic acid (PA)
    concentration: 0.25 mM
    preparation: BSA-conjugated
  - name: Insulin solution
    concentration: 100 nM
    preparation: Diluted in appropriate buffer
  - name: Complete culture medium
    notes: Use media appropriate for cell type

# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Prepare BSA-conjugated OA and PA mixture"
    details: "Final concentration: 0.25 mM OA, 0.25 mM PA (0.5 mM total, 1:1 ratio)"
  - step: 2
    action: "Prepare insulin working solution"
    details: "Dilute stock insulin to 100 nM final concentration"
  - step: 3
    action: "Treat cells with OAPA and insulin simultaneously"
    details: "Add both treatments to culture medium before applying to cells"
  - step: 4
    action: "Incubate for 24h with combined treatment"
    details: "Maintain standard culture conditions during incubation"
  - step: 5
    action: "Set up appropriate controls"
    details: "Include BSA-only control, insulin-only control, and untreated control"

# Experimental context
experimental_notes:
  - condition: "Combined fatty acid and insulin stimulation"
  - condition: "Medium dose OAPA (0.5 mM total)"
  - condition: "Standard insulin dose (100 nM)"
  - note: "This protocol tests the interaction between fatty acid loading and insulin signaling"
  
# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves and eye protection required"
  hazards: "Avoid direct contact with concentrated fatty acids"

# Data collection
data_collection:
  timepoints: [0h, 6h, 12h, 24h]
  measurements:
    - "Insulin signaling pathway activation (Western blot)"
    - "Lipid accumulation (Oil Red O staining)"
    - "Gene expression changes (qPCR)"
