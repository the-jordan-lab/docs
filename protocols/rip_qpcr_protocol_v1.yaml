# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Crosslinking method selection"
    details: "UV is more specific for direct interactions; formaldehyde captures larger complexes"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Poor RNA yield"
    solution: "Increase starting material; optimize crosslinking conditions; check for RNase contamination"
  - problem: "High background in control IPs"
    solution: "Increase wash stringency; pre-block beads with BSA/tRNA; use more specific antibody"
  - problem: "No enrichment of target RNA"
    solution: "Verify protein-RNA interaction using alternative approach; check crosslinking efficiency; try different antibody"

# Method comparisons
considerations:
  uv_crosslinking:
    - advantage: "Standardize irradiation distance/energy for reproducibility"
    - advantage: "More specific crosslinks between directly interacting residues"
    - advantage: "Better for pinpointing precise binding sites"
    - disadvantage: "Requires specialized equipment (UV crosslinker)"
    - disadvantage: "May damage RNA integrity at high doses"
    - note: "More common in CLIP-based methods for precise interaction mapping"
  formaldehyde_crosslinking:
    - advantage: "Straightforward chemical method without specialized equipment"
    - advantage: "Captures indirect interactions within larger complexes"
    - advantage: "Often higher yield"
    - disadvantage: "Higher background from nonspecific crosslinks"
    - disadvantage: "Reversal requires potentially harsh conditions (heating, high salt)"
    - note: "Better for detecting weak or transient interactions"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves, and eye protection required"
  hazards: "UV radiation: avoid direct exposure; Formaldehyde: toxic and carcinogenic, use in fume hood"
  waste: "Dispose of crosslinking reagents according to institutional guidelines"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "Include IgG control IP"
    criteria: "Should show minimal enrichment of target RNAs"
  - check: "Include input RNA sample"
    criteria: "For normalization and calculating percent input"
  - check: "Test known RNA-protein interaction"
    criteria: "Should show significant enrichment over IgG control"

# Data analysis
data_analysis:

# Best practices
best_practices:

  - "Test different crosslinking strengths and confirm with a known positive RNA target"
  - "Include IgG control or nonspecific antibody to measure background binding"
  - "Use input RNA to normalize or calculate percentage of input in qPCR"
  - "If possible, use a known RNA-protein interaction as positive control"
  - "Incorporate RNase inhibitors in all buffers and keep samples cold"
  - "For many RIP-qPCR experiments, mild UV crosslinking at 254 nm is preferred"

# Notes
notes: |
  - Two crosslinking methods are described: UV (254 nm) and formaldehyde
  - UV crosslinking is more specific but requires specialized equipment
  - Formaldehyde crosslinking is simpler but may have higher background
  - Always include appropriate controls (IgG, input RNA)
  - Consider CLIP-based methods for more precise mapping of binding sites
  - For studying RNA binding proteins that interact with many targets, consider combining with RNA-seq (RIP-seq)
