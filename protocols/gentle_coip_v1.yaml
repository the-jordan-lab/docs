    details: "Collect precleared lysate by centrifugation or magnetic separation"
  - step: 5
    action: "Aliquot lysate"

  - step: 6
    action: "Add antibody"
    details: "Add 2 μg of antibody to each tube"
  - step: 7
    action: "Incubate overnight"
    details: "Rotate tubes overnight at 4°C to allow antibody binding"
  - step: 8

    details: "Add 100 μL of bead solution to each tube"
  - step: 11
    action: "Capture complexes"
    details: "Rotate at room temperature for 1 hour to capture antibody-protein complexes"
  - step: 12
    action: "Wash beads"
    details: "Wash beads 3X with 1 mL PBS + 0.02% Tween using gentle pipet mixing (no extended rotation)"
  - step: 13
    action: "Transfer beads"
    details: "After final wash, resuspend beads in 200 μL PBS + 0.02% Tween and transfer to fresh LoBind tubes"
  - step: 14
    action: "Elute proteins"
    details: "Add 30 μL 1X non-denaturing loading buffer and incubate at 37°C for 5 minutes"

    details: "Separate solution from beads into new LoBind tubes"
  - step: 16
    action: "Freeze samples"
    details: "Snap freeze eluate in liquid nitrogen"
  - step: 17
    action: "Store samples"
    details: "Store at -80°C until analysis"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Gentleness of handling"
    details: "Avoid harsh mixing or vortexing to preserve protein-protein interactions"
  - parameter: "Washing steps"
    details: "Brief, gentle washes without extended rotation periods minimize disruption of complexes"
  - parameter: "Temperature"
    details: "Maintain 4°C during initial binding to reduce non-specific interactions"
  - parameter: "Elution conditions"
    details: "Use non-denaturing conditions and mild temperature (37°C vs 95°C)"

# Controls
controls:
  - control: "IgG control"
    purpose: "Use matched isotype IgG instead of specific antibody to identify non-specific binding"
  - control: "Input sample"
    purpose: "Save an aliquot of pre-IP lysate to verify presence of proteins in starting material"
  - control: "Beads-only control"
    purpose: "Beads without antibody to identify proteins binding directly to beads"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Low or no co-immunoprecipitated protein"
    solution: "Increase lysate amount; reduce washing stringency; verify antibody efficacy; use crosslinking"
  - problem: "High background"
    solution: "Increase preclearance time; use more stringent wash buffer; validate antibody specificity"
  - problem: "Degraded proteins"
    solution: "Add additional protease inhibitors; work more quickly; keep samples cold"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves, and eye protection required"
  hazards: "Liquid nitrogen causes freeze burns; handle with appropriate PPE and in well-ventilated area"

# Downstream applications
downstream_applications:
  - name: "Western blotting"
    preparation: "Add SDS sample buffer if needed; may need to optimize antibody to avoid IP antibody detection"
  - name: "Mass spectrometry"
    preparation: "Consider specific elution methods compatible with MS analysis"

# Notes
notes: |
  - This is a gentle protocol designed to preserve protein-protein interactions
  - Uses minimal washing steps without extended rotations
  - Includes preclearance step to reduce non-specific binding
  - Remember to freeze Input and leftover samples
  - For weaker interactions, consider chemical crosslinking before lysis
  - Non-denaturing loading buffer preserves complexes for native gel electrophoresis
  - Alternative elution methods include peptide competition or pH elution
  - For subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis, an aliquot can be mixed with standard denaturing loading buffer
