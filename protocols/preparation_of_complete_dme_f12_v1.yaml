    amount: 500 mL bottle
    storage: 4°C
    supplier: Recommended supplier
  - name: Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)
    amount: 50 mL (10% final)
    storage: -20°C (stock), thawed before use
    supplier: Recommended supplier, heat-inactivated
  - name: Penicillin-Streptomycin (PS)
    amount: 5 mL (1% final)
    storage: -20°C
    supplier: Recommended supplier, 100X concentration
  - name: Sterile 50-mL tube
    type: Conical, polypropylene

# Equipment required
equipment:
  - name: Biosafety cabinet
    certification: Class II
  - name: Water bath or incubator
    temperature: 37°C
    use: For thawing FBS
  - name: Pipette aid
    range: For 5-50 mL volumes
  - name: Pipettes
    range: Serological, various sizes
  - name: Refrigerator
    temperature: 4°C
    use: For media storage

# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Prepare materials"
    details: "Allow media to warm to room temperature; thaw FBS and PS at 37°C"
  - step: 2
    action: "Set up biosafety cabinet"
    details: "Turn on biosafety cabinet 15 minutes before use; clean with 70% ethanol"
  - step: 3
    action: "Aliquot plain media"
    details: "Transfer ~51 mL of DME/F-12 media into a sterile 50-mL tube and label as 'PLAIN DME/F-12'"
  - step: 4
    action: "Add FBS"
    details: "To the remaining 449 mL of media in the original bottle, add 50 mL Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)"
  - step: 5
    action: "Add antibiotics"
    details: "Add 5 mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (PS) solution to the main bottle"
  - step: 6
    action: "Mix gently"
    details: "Invert bottle several times to mix thoroughly, avoiding bubble formation"
  - step: 7
    action: "Label media"
    details: "Label bottle with 'Complete DME/F-12', date of preparation, and expiration date (1 month from preparation)"
  - step: 8
    action: "Store media"
    details: "Store both complete and plain media at 4°C"

# Final composition
final_composition:
  - component: "DME/F-12 basal medium"
    percentage: "89%"
    function: "Provides essential nutrients and buffering"
  - component: "Fetal Bovine Serum"
    percentage: "10%"
    function: "Provides growth factors and proteins for cell growth"
  - component: "Penicillin-Streptomycin"
    percentage: "1%"
    function: "Prevents bacterial contamination"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Sterility"
    details: "All components must be handled aseptically in a biosafety cabinet"
  - parameter: "FBS quality"
    details: "FBS should be heat-inactivated and from a validated lot known to support growth of target cells"
  - parameter: "Expiration"
    details: "Complete medium should be used within 1 month of preparation"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Media color change"
    solution: "If phenol red indicator turns yellow, pH is too acidic; discard media"
  - problem: "Precipitation in media"
    solution: "Check for contamination; sometimes precipitates from FBS can be removed by filtration"
  - problem: "Cell growth issues"
    solution: "Test alternative FBS lots; verify proper storage conditions"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves required"
  hazards: "Minimal hazards; follow standard laboratory safety practices"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "pH indicator"
    criteria: "Phenol red should appear pink-red (not yellow or purple)"
  - check: "Sterility test"
    criteria: "Incubate a sample at 37°C for 72 hours to verify no contamination"
  - check: "Cell growth test"
    criteria: "Test with standard cell line to verify growth support"

# Notes
notes: |
  - This protocol creates both complete DME/F-12 (with FBS and antibiotics) and plain DME/F-12
  - Complete medium contains 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin
  - For specialty applications, additional supplements may be required
  - Some cell lines may require different FBS concentrations (5-20%)
  - If preparing larger or smaller volumes, adjust component volumes proportionally
  - For sensitive cell types, consider using reduced serum or serum-free formulations
  - For long-term storage, complete media can be aliquoted into working volumes to reduce freeze-thaw cycles
