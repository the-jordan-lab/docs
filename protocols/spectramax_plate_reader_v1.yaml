# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Plate orientation"
    details: "Always insert plate with well H1 in bottom-left corner to match software layout"
  - parameter: "Bubbles in wells"
    details: "Remove bubbles as they can interfere with readings"
  - parameter: "Blank wells"
    details: "Include blank wells for background subtraction"
  - parameter: "Wavelength selection"
    details: "Match wavelength to assay requirements"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Abnormally high readings"
    solution: "Check for bubbles; ensure proper blank subtraction; verify wavelength setting"
  - problem: "Low or no signal"
    solution: "Verify wavelength; check sample preparation; ensure plate orientation is correct"
  - problem: "Inconsistent readings"
    solution: "Mix wells before reading; check for condensation on plate lid; avoid edge effects"
  - problem: "Software errors"
    solution: "Restart software; contact core facility manager if issues persist"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Follow standard laboratory safety procedures"
  hazards: "Low risk; handle plates containing potentially hazardous materials appropriately"

# Data analysis tips
data_analysis:
  - tip: "Always subtract blank well readings"
    details: "Average multiple blank wells for more accurate background correction"
  - tip: "Standard curves"
    details: "Use appropriate curve fitting (linear, 4-parameter, etc.) based on assay type"
  - tip: "Technical replicates"
    details: "Calculate mean and standard deviation across replicate wells"

  - "SpectraMax user manual (available at core facility)"
  - "Assay-specific references based on experiment type"

# Notes
notes: |
  - Settings may need to be adjusted depending on the specific assay
  - Always ensure the plate is properly oriented when loading (H1 position at bottom-left)
  - Remember to transfer your data before leaving the facility
  - For specialized readings (kinetic, spectral scans, etc.), consult the core facility manager
  - Some assays may benefit from plate shaking prior to reading
  - If using a plate with a lid, remove it before measurement unless protocol specifically indicates otherwise
