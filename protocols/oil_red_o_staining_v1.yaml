  - step: 2
    action: "Normalize data (optional)"
    details: "Normalize to cell number, protein content, or DNA content if needed"
  - step: 3
    action: "Statistical analysis"
    details: "Compare experimental groups using appropriate statistical tests"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Solution filtration"
    details: "Filtration of ORO working solution is critical to prevent particulate artifacts"
  - parameter: "Drying before staining"
    details: "Complete drying after PBS wash ensures optimal stain uptake"
  - parameter: "Timing of isopropanol extraction"
    details: "Standardize agitation time (5 minutes) for reproducible extraction"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "High background staining"
    solution: "Ensure complete washing steps; check quality of ORO solutions"
  - problem: "Weak or uneven staining"
    solution: "Check ORO solution freshness; ensure cells were completely dry before staining"

    solution: "Filter ORO solution thoroughly; prepare fresh working solution"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves, and eye protection required"
  hazards: "PFA is toxic; isopropanol is flammable; dispose of waste according to institutional guidelines"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "Include positive control"
    criteria: "Cell line known to accumulate lipid droplets (e.g., differentiated 3T3-L1 cells)"
  - check: "Include negative control"
    criteria: "Untreated cells or cells with minimal lipid accumulation"

# Notes
notes: |
  - Optimized for hepatocyte-like cells (HepG2, Huh7, AML12)
  - Filtration of ORO solution is critical for good results
  - Volume specifications are for 96-well plates - adjust for other formats
  - For automated image analysis, consider using ImageJ/CellProfiler for quantification
  - ORO stains neutral lipids (primarily triglycerides) red
  - Semi-quantitative absorbance measurements correlate with total neutral lipid content
