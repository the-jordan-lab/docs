# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Seed cells in 24-well plate"
    details: "Seed 5x10^4 cells/well 24 hours prior to transfection to achieve 60-80% confluence at time of transfection"
  - step: 2
    action: "Prepare siRNA dilutions"
    details: "For each siRNA, dilute 10 pmol siRNA in 50 µL Opti-MEM per well"
  - step: 3
    action: "Prepare RNAiMAX dilution"
    details: "In a separate tube, dilute 1.5 µL RNAiMAX in 50 µL Opti-MEM per well"
  - step: 4
    action: "Create transfection complexes"
    details: "Combine diluted siRNA and RNAiMAX solutions, mix gently, and incubate for 10-20 min at room temperature"
  - step: 5
    action: "Add complexes to cells"
    details: "Add 100 µL siRNA-RNAiMAX complex dropwise to each well containing cells in 400 µL growth medium"
  - step: 6
    action: "Incubate cells"
    details: "Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24-72 hours before assessing knockdown efficiency"
  - step: 7
    action: "Change medium (optional)"
    details: "After 4-6 hours, replace transfection medium with fresh complete medium if needed for sensitive cells"

# Experimental design

  - layout: |
      Typical 24-well plate layout:
      | 1-siNC  | 2-siNC  | 3-siNC  | 4-empty |
      | 1-siRNA1| 2-siRNA1| 3-siRNA1| 4-empty |
      | 1-siRNA2| 2-siRNA2| 3-siRNA2| 4-empty |
      | 1-siRNA3| 2-siRNA3| 3-siRNA3| 4-empty |
      | 5-empty | 6-empty |etc.

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Cell density"
    details: "60-80% confluence at time of transfection is optimal"
  - parameter: "siRNA concentration"
    details: "10 nM is standard but may need optimization (5-50 nM range)"
  - parameter: "RNAiMAX:siRNA ratio"
    details: "May need adjustment for different cell lines"
  - parameter: "Incubation time"
    details: "10-20 minutes for complex formation; overly long incubation may reduce efficiency"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Low transfection efficiency"
    solution: "Optimize cell density, increase RNAiMAX amount, extend transfection time"
  - problem: "High cytotoxicity"
    solution: "Reduce siRNA/RNAiMAX concentrations, change medium 4-6h post-transfection"
  - problem: "Poor knockdown"
    solution: "Verify siRNA design, extend incubation time post-transfection, consider alternative delivery method"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves, and eye protection required"
  hazards: "RNAiMAX may cause irritation; handle with care"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "Include siNC (non-targeting control) in every experiment"
    criteria: "Should show no target gene knockdown"
  - check: "Verify knockdown efficiency"
    criteria: "Typically by qPCR or Western blot 24-72h post-transfection"

# Notes
notes: |
  - siNC is a non-targeting negative control siRNA
  - Adjust cell number and reagent volumes as needed for specific cell lines
  - For sensitive cells, transfect in antibiotic-free medium
  - Assay for knockdown 24-72 hours post-transfection depending on target protein half-life
  - Consider optimizing siRNA concentration (5-50 nM range) for your specific cell line
  - Perform reverse transfection as an alternative by adding complexes to wells before adding cells
