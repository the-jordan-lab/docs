category: equipment-maintenance

# Materials required
materials:
  - name: 70% ethanol
    preparation: Freshly prepared or commercially available
    storage: Flammable cabinet
  - name: Paper towels
    type: Lint-free, laboratory-grade
  - name: Spray bottle
    use: For ethanol application
  - name: Biohazard waste container
    use: For disposal of contaminated materials

# Equipment required
equipment:
  - name: Laminar flow hood
    type: Class II biosafety cabinet
  - name: Gloves
    type: Nitrile or latex
  - name: Lab coat
    use: Personal protective equipment

# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Clear the work area"
    details: "Remove all materials, reagents, and equipment from the hood"
  - step: 2
    action: "Return items to storage"
    details: "Return all items to their original places; dispose of waste properly"
  - step: 3
    action: "Spray work surface"
    details: "Spray all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol, including the back and side walls"
  - step: 4
    action: "Wipe surfaces"
    details: "Wipe down all interior surfaces with paper towels in a front-to-back motion"
  - step: 5
    action: "Clean the sash"
    details: "Spray and wipe the sash/glass shield on both sides"
  - step: 6
    action: "Final inspection"
    details: "Ensure all surfaces are dry and no items remain in the cabinet"
  - step: 7
    action: "Lower the sash"
    details: "Close the cabinet to the appropriate position according to manufacturer's guidelines"
  - step: 8
    action: "Activate UV light" 
    details: "Turn on UV light if available (many cabinets activate this automatically when closed)"
  - step: 9
    action: "Turn off equipment"
    details: "Turn off vacuum, microscope, and other associated equipment"
  - step: 10
    action: "Turn off room lights"
    details: "Turn off lights when leaving the cell culture room if you are the last person"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Cleaning direction"
    details: "Always wipe from clean to dirty areas (typically back to front) to avoid spreading contaminants"
  - parameter: "Complete coverage"
    details: "Ensure all surfaces that may have been contacted are thoroughly cleaned"
  - parameter: "Appropriate disinfectant"
    details: "70% ethanol is standard; for specific contaminants, follow institutional guidelines"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Persistent odor in hood"
    solution: "Perform thorough cleaning; check for spills beneath work surface; notify lab manager if odor persists"
  - problem: "Visible contamination"
    solution: "Clean affected area immediately; if extensive, consult lab manager for decontamination protocol"
  - problem: "UV light not functioning"
    solution: "Report to lab manager; UV bulbs have limited lifespan and require periodic replacement"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat and gloves required"
  hazards: "70% ethanol is flammable; ensure all sources of ignition are distant from working area"
  waste: "Dispose of contaminated materials in appropriate biohazard container"
  uv_safety: "Never look directly at UV light; ensure cabinet is fully closed before UV cycle begins"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "Visual inspection"
    criteria: "No visible debris, media spills, or residue should remain"
  - check: "Airflow indicator"
    criteria: "Verify proper airflow indicators before next use"

# Maintenance schedule
maintenance_schedule:
  - frequency: "After each use"
    action: "Surface cleaning with 70% ethanol"
  - frequency: "Weekly"
    action: "More thorough cleaning including work area under removable surfaces"
  - frequency: "Annually"
    action: "Professional certification and maintenance by qualified technician"

  - "World Health Organization. (2004) Laboratory Biosafety Manual, 3rd Edition"

# Notes
notes: |
  - This protocol should be followed after every use of the laminar flow hood
  - Ensures proper sterilization and extends the life of the equipment
  - UV light exposure time should be at least 15-30 minutes for effective surface decontamination
  - UV light does not penetrate dust or organic material, so physical cleaning must always precede UV sterilization
  - Report any malfunction or damage to lab manager immediately
  - Never use bleach in stainless steel biosafety cabinets unless specifically approved by manufacturer
  - Leave blower running continuously in most biosafety cabinets; consult lab-specific policy
