# Experimental design
experimental_design:
  - condition: "YBX1 siRNA transfected cells"
    purpose: "Test condition to examine effect of YBX1 depletion on mRNA stability"
  - condition: "Negative control siRNA transfected cells"
    purpose: "Control condition to establish baseline mRNA decay rates"

  - gene: "Genes with m6A or m5C modifications"
    details: "YBX1 often interacts with methylated RNAs"

    details: "Particularly those with known AU-rich elements or other stability determinants"
  - gene: "Reference genes"
    details: "18S rRNA, GAPDH, or ACTB for normalization; select stable genes under actinomycin D treatment"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "siRNA knockdown efficiency"
    details: "Verify >70% reduction in YBX1 mRNA levels before proceeding with stability assay"
  - parameter: "Actinomycin D concentration"
    details: "5 μg/mL is standard but may require optimization for specific cell types"

    solution: "Optimize transfection conditions; try alternative siRNA sequences; increase siRNA concentration"
  - problem: "Cell toxicity"
    solution: "Reduce actinomycin D concentration; optimize cell density; reduce exposure time"

    solution: "Standardize cell culture conditions; ensure consistent RNA extraction quality; use technical qPCR replicates"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, nitrile gloves required"
  hazards: "Actinomycin D is toxic and mutagenic; TRIzol contains phenol; handle both in fume hood only"
  disposal: "Dispose of actinomycin D and TRIzol waste according to institutional hazardous waste procedures"

# Data analysis
data_analysis:
  - step: "Normalize qPCR data to reference gene(s) at each time point"
  - step: "Express each time point relative to t=0 (set as 100% or 1.0)"

# Notes
notes: |
  - For optimal results, verify YBX1 knockdown efficiency before proceeding with actinomycin D treatment
  - Use 18S rRNA or GAPDH as reference genes for normalization, but confirm their stability under your experimental conditions
  - Target genes should include those known to be regulated post-transcriptionally, particularly those with m5C or m6A modifications
  - The optimal actinomycin D concentration may vary by cell type; preliminary testing is recommended
  - Actinomycin D is toxic; handle with care and dispose of properly
  - For very stable mRNAs, time points may need to be extended beyond 8h
  - Consider including a protein synthesis inhibitor control (e.g., cycloheximide) to distinguish direct vs indirect effects
  - For more precise measurements, consider RNA-Seq for global mRNA stability profiling
