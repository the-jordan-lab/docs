# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Determine the number of standards and unknown samples to quantify"
    details: "Plan for technical replicates (typically 2-3) for each standard and unknown"
  - step: 2
    action: "Calculate total Working Reagent (WR) volume"
    details: "(# standards + # unknowns) × (# replicates) × (volume of WR per sample)"
  - step: 3
    action: "Prepare Working Reagent (WR)"
    details: "Mix 50 parts BCA reagent A with 1 part BCA reagent B (50:1 ratio). Example: Combine 5 mL of reagent A with 0.1 mL of reagent B to prepare 5.1 mL WR"
  - step: 4
    action: "Pipette 10 µL of each standard or unknown sample replicate into a microplate well"
    details: "Maintain consistent technique to minimize variability"
  - step: 5
    action: "Add 200 µL of the WR to each well"
    details: "Mix thoroughly for 30 seconds using plate shaker or pipette"
  - step: 6
    action: "Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes"
    details: "Cover plate to prevent evaporation"
  - step: 7
    action: "Measure the absorbance at 562 nm on plate reader"
    details: "Allow plate to cool to room temperature before measuring if needed"

# Analysis
analysis:
  - step: 1
    action: "Subtract the average 562 nm blank value from all other standards and unknown samples"
    details: "This corrects for background absorbance"
  - step: 2
    action: "Plot standard curve"
    details: "Graph blank-corrected 562 nm measurements vs. BSA concentration (µg/mL)"
  - step: 3
    action: "Calculate unknown protein concentrations"
    details: "Use the standard curve to determine protein concentration of unknown samples"
  - step: 4
    action: "Apply dilution factor if applicable"
    details: "Multiply calculated concentration by dilution factor to get original sample concentration"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Sample:WR ratio"
    details: "Maintain consistent 1:20 ratio (10 μL sample to 200 μL WR) for accurate results"
  - parameter: "Incubation time and temperature"
    details: "Strictly adhere to 30 minutes at 37°C for reproducible results"
  - parameter: "Standard curve fit"
    details: "Use a four-parameter (quadratic) or best-fit curve instead of purely linear fit for best accuracy"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "High background in blank wells"
    solution: "Ensure clean labware and high-quality reagents; check for contamination"
  - problem: "Poor standard curve linearity"
    solution: "Verify accurate pipetting technique and fresh standards"
  - problem: "Samples out of range"
    solution: "Dilute high-concentration samples and re-assay; increase volume for low-concentration samples"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves, and eye protection required"
  hazards: "BCA reagents contain sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate; avoid contact with skin and eyes"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "R² value of standard curve"
    criteria: "Should be > 0.98 for reliable quantitation"
  - check: "Technical replicate consistency"
    criteria: "CV < 10% between replicates"

# Notes
notes: |
  - Dilute standards in the same buffer used to collect your protein samples
  - Wavelengths from 540-590 nm have been used successfully with this method
  - Plate readers require greater sample:WR ratio than cuvette spectrophotometers
  - Increasing incubation time (up to 2 hours) or ratio of sample volume to WR increases sensitivity
  - This assay works on the biuret reaction principle: Cu+2 is reduced to Cu+1 by protein
  - The Cu+1 is detected using BCA, forming a purple complex absorbing at 562 nm
  - The assay is nearly linear for protein concentrations from 20-2000 µg/mL
