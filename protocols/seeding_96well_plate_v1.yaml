# Cell density guidelines
cell_density_guidelines:
  - cell_type: "HEK293"
    density: "10,000-15,000 cells/well"
    notes: "Fast-growing, adhere quickly"
  - cell_type: "HepG2"
    density: "15,000-20,000 cells/well"
    notes: "Form clumps, mix well before seeding"
  - cell_type: "Primary hepatocytes"
    density: "20,000-40,000 cells/well"
    notes: "Use collagen-coated plates"
  - cell_type: "Fibroblasts"
    density: "5,000-10,000 cells/well"
    notes: "Spread widely, use lower density"
  - cell_type: "MCF7"
    density: "10,000-15,000 cells/well"
    notes: "Medium growth rate"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Cell suspension homogeneity"
    details: "Mix suspension frequently to prevent cell settling and ensure even distribution"
  - parameter: "Seeding technique"
    details: "Maintain consistent angle and speed with multi-channel pipette to ensure uniform volumes"
  - parameter: "Edge effects"
    details: "Consider filling outer wells with PBS for long-term experiments to minimize evaporation"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Uneven cell distribution"
    solution: "Mix cell suspension more frequently; check pipette calibration; avoid bubbles when dispensing"
  - problem: "Edge wells drying out"
    solution: "Fill outer wells with sterile PBS or water; use humidified chamber in incubator"
  - problem: "Cell clumping"
    solution: "Triturate cell suspension gently before seeding; ensure complete dissociation during harvesting"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves, and eye protection required"
  hazards: "Follow appropriate biosafety procedures for cell line being used"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "Even seeding"
    criteria: "Visually inspect plate under microscope for uniform cell distribution"
  - check: "Cell density"
    criteria: "Count cells in representative wells to verify target density was achieved"
  - check: "Sterility"
    criteria: "Include at least one well with media only to check for contamination"

# Notes
notes: |
  - Plate type should be selected based on the planned assay (clear for brightfield, black for fluorescence)
  - Always mix suspension frequently to ensure even cell distribution
  - Consistent seeding technique is important for reproducible results
  - For cell attachment assays, check attachment at 2-4 hours post-seeding
  - For proliferation assays, cells typically need 24 hours to recover before treatment
  - Consider using a repeater pipette for very large numbers of plates
  - For high-throughput screening, automated cell dispensers can improve consistency
