# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Prepare materials"
    details: "Allow media to warm to room temperature; thaw FBS, ITS, and PS at 37°C"
  - step: 2
    action: "Set up biosafety cabinet"
    details: "Turn on biosafety cabinet 15 minutes before use; clean with 70% ethanol"
  - step: 3
    action: "Aliquot plain media"
    details: "Transfer ~55 mL of DME/F-12 media into a sterile 50-mL tube and label as 'PLAIN DME/F-12'"
  - step: 4
    action: "Add FBS"
    details: "To the remaining 445 mL of media in the original bottle, add 50 mL Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)"
  - step: 5
    action: "Add ITS supplement"
    details: "Add 5 mL Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS) solution to the main bottle"
  - step: 6
    action: "Add dexamethasone"
    details: "Add 5 μL of 10 mM dexamethasone stock solution (final concentration 1 nM)"
  - step: 7
    action: "Add antibiotics"
    details: "Add 5 mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (PS) solution to the main bottle"
  - step: 8
    action: "Mix gently"
    details: "Invert bottle several times to mix thoroughly, avoiding bubble formation"
  - step: 9
    action: "Label media"
    details: "Label bottle with 'Complete DME/F-12 ITS-D', date of preparation, and expiration date (2-3 weeks from preparation)"
  - step: 10
    action: "Store media"
    details: "Store both complete and plain media at 4°C; protect from light if possible"

# Final composition
final_composition:
  - component: "DME/F-12 basal medium"
    percentage: "88%"
    function: "Provides essential nutrients and buffering"
  - component: "Fetal Bovine Serum"
    percentage: "10%"
    function: "Provides growth factors and proteins for cell growth"
  - component: "Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium"
    percentage: "1%"
    function: "Insulin: promotes glucose uptake; Transferrin: iron carrier; Selenium: antioxidant"
  - component: "Dexamethasone"
    concentration: "1 nM"
    function: "Glucocorticoid that promotes cell differentiation in certain cell types"
  - component: "Penicillin-Streptomycin"
    percentage: "1%"
    function: "Prevents bacterial contamination"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Sterility"
    details: "All components must be handled aseptically in a biosafety cabinet"
  - parameter: "Dexamethasone concentration"
    details: "Accurate pipetting of small volume (5 μL) is critical; consider using serial dilutions"
  - parameter: "Expiration"
    details: "Media with ITS may have shorter shelf life (2-3 weeks) compared to standard media"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Precipitate formation"
    solution: "May occur with ITS; warm to room temperature and mix gently; filtration may be required"
  - problem: "Cell differentiation issues"
    solution: "Verify dexamethasone concentration; prepare fresh medium; check ITS potency"
  - problem: "Media color change"
    solution: "If phenol red indicator turns yellow, pH is too acidic; discard media"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves required"
  hazards: "Minimal hazards; follow standard laboratory safety practices"
  dexamethasone: "Potent steroid hormone; avoid skin contact"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "pH indicator"
    criteria: "Phenol red should appear pink-red (not yellow or purple)"
  - check: "Sterility test"
    criteria: "Incubate a sample at 37°C for 72 hours to verify no contamination"
  - check: "Functional test"
    criteria: "Test with appropriate cell differentiation model if possible"

# Notes
notes: |
  - This specialized medium contains additional supplements:
    - 10% FBS
    - 1% ITS
    - 1 nM dexamethasone
    - 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin
  - ITS supplement is typically used to reduce serum requirements or enhance differentiation
  - Dexamethasone concentration (1 nM) is suitable for differentiation of certain cell types
  - For more potent glucocorticoid effects, concentration can be increased to 10-100 nM
  - For long-term studies, consider preparing smaller volumes of media more frequently
  - Some cell types may require adaptation period when switching to ITS-supplemented media
