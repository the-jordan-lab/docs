# Materials required
materials:
  - name: Cell culture flask with cells
    notes: 70-90% confluent
  - name: PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
    concentration: 1X, sterile
    temperature: Room temperature
  - name: Tryp-LE or trypsin-EDTA
    temperature: Pre-warmed to 37°C
    storage: -20°C (stock), 4°C (working)
  - name: Complete media
    temperature: Pre-warmed to 37°C
  - name: New culture flask
    type: T25, T75, or T175 as needed
  - name: 70% ethanol
    preparation: Freshly prepared or commercially available
    use: Surface disinfection

# Equipment required
equipment:
  - name: Biosafety cabinet
    certification: Class II
  - name: CO2 incubator
    settings: 37°C, 5% CO2, humidified
  - name: Centrifuge
    settings: 200-300g for 5 minutes
  - name: Aspiration system
    type: Vacuum or manual
  - name: Hemocytometer or cell counter (optional)
    use: Cell counting if precise seeding is required

# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Prepare workstation"
    details: "Turn on biosafety cabinet, sterilize surfaces and materials with 70% ethanol"
  - step: 2
    action: "Maintain sterile technique"
    details: "Spray gloved hands with 70% ethanol after touching anything outside the hood"
  - step: 3
    action: "Aspirate old media"
    details: "Carefully remove all media without disturbing cell layer"
  - step: 4
    action: "Wash cells with PBS"
    details: "Add sufficient PBS to cover the cell layer, gently rock, then aspirate"
  - step: 5
    action: "Add dissociation reagent"
    details: "Add 1 ml Tryp-LE per T25 flask (scale accordingly for larger flasks)"
  - step: 6
    action: "Incubate cells"
    details: "Place in incubator for 5-10 minutes until cells detach"
  - step: 7
    action: "Check cell detachment"
    details: "Observe under microscope to confirm cells are rounded and detached"
  - step: 8
    action: "Neutralize and collect cells"
    details: "Add 9 ml complete media, pipette gently to dislodge and disperse cells"
  - step: 9
    action: "Seed new flask"
    details: "Transfer 1 ml cell suspension to new flask containing 9 ml complete media (1:10 split ratio)"
  - step: 10
    action: "Label flask"
    details: "Note cell line, passage number, date, and your initials"
  - step: 11
    action: "Incubate cells"
    details: "Place in incubator at 37°C with 5% CO₂"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Confluence level"
    details: "Ideal passage at 70-90% confluence; overconfluent cells may exhibit altered properties"
  - parameter: "Dissociation time"
    details: "Excessive trypsinization can damage cells; insufficient time leads to poor detachment"
  - parameter: "Split ratio"
    details: "Adjust based on growth rate and experimental timeline (1:3 to 1:20 depending on cell line)"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Cells not detaching"
    solution: "Extend incubation time with dissociation reagent, tap flask gently, or try fresh trypsin"
  - problem: "Cell clumping"
    solution: "Pipette gently up and down to create single-cell suspension; use cell strainer if needed"
  - problem: "Poor cell recovery/growth"
    solution: "Check media quality, incubator conditions, and avoid over-trypsinization"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves, and closed-toe shoes required"
  hazards: "Handle biological materials according to biosafety level requirements"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "Cell morphology"
    criteria: "Cells should maintain typical morphology post-passage"
  - check: "Growth rate"
    criteria: "Consistent doubling time compared to historical data for the cell line"

# Notes
notes: |
  - This protocol describes a 1:10 split ratio
  - Incubation time with Tryp-LE may vary depending on cell line
  - Maintain sterile technique throughout the procedure
  - Consider counting cells for experiments requiring precise cell numbers
  - Record passage number with each subculture
  - Some cell lines may require specialized coating on flasks (collagen, poly-L-lysine, etc.)
  - Check specific requirements for your cell line, as some may need different media or culture conditions
