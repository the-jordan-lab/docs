# Solutions preparation
solutions:
  - name: 150 mM NaCl solution
    preparation: "Dilute 60 μL of 5 M NaCl with 1940 μL water"
    volume: 2 mL
  - name: Saturated NaHCO₃ solution
    preparation: "Dissolve 13.6 mg NaHCO₃ in 46 μL distilled water"
    volume: 46 μL

# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Prepare BSA solution"
    details: "Dissolve 0.64 g fatty acid-free BSA in 1.5 mL of 150 mM NaCl solution, then add water to reach 2 mL total volume (4.8 mM BSA final)"
  - step: 2
    action: "Prepare saturated NaHCO₃ solution"
    details: "Dissolve 13.6 mg NaHCO₃ in 46 μL distilled water; warm at 65°C to ensure complete dissolution"
  - step: 3
    action: "Prepare fatty acid solution"
    details: "Add approximately 5 mg palmitic acid (or equivalent amount for oleic or arachidonic acid) to the NaHCO₃ solution and incubate at 65°C for 2 minutes to form the sodium salt"
  - step: 4
    action: "Combine solutions"
    details: "Transfer 1.6 mL of the BSA solution into the tube containing the fatty acid mixture"
  - step: 5
    action: "Incubate combined solution"
    details: "Incubate at 37°C for 70 minutes with occasional gentle mixing to promote fatty acid binding to BSA"
  - step: 6
    action: "Filter solution"
    details: "Filter the final mixture through a 0.2 μm filter to remove any undissolved particles"
  - step: 7
    action: "Measure fatty acid concentration"
    details: "Use the Wako NEFA-HR assay to measure the fatty acid concentration (expected around 10 mM; roughly a 2:1 fatty acid to BSA molar ratio)"
  - step: 8
    action: "Store solution"
    details: "Aliquot if needed and store at -20°C or 4°C depending on timeframe for use"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Fatty acid solubilization"
    details: "Complete dissolution of fatty acids in NaHCO₃ is critical for proper complexation"
  - parameter: "Temperature control"
    details: "Maintain 65°C during solubilization and 37°C during complexation for optimal results"
  - parameter: "BSA quality"
    details: "Use fatty acid-free BSA to ensure accurate FA:BSA ratios"

# Calculations
calculations:
  - calculation: "BSA molarity"
    formula: "4.8 mM = 0.64 g ÷ 66,430 g/mol ÷ 0.002 L"
  - calculation: "Expected FA:BSA ratio"
    formula: "10 mM FA ÷ 4.8 mM BSA ≈ 2:1 ratio"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Fatty acid precipitation"
    solution: "Ensure complete dissolution in NaHCO₃ before adding BSA; increase incubation time at 65°C"
  - problem: "Low final concentration"
    solution: "Verify fatty acid weight; extend binding incubation time; optimize NaHCO₃ concentration"
  - problem: "Solution turbidity"
    solution: "Filter solution multiple times; decrease fatty acid:BSA ratio"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat and gloves required"
  hazards: "NaHCO₃ is irritating to eyes; use caution with hot water baths"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "Fatty acid concentration"
    criteria: "Should be approximately 10 mM when measured by NEFA-HR assay"
  - check: "Solution clarity"
    criteria: "Should be clear with no visible precipitate after filtration"

# Notes
notes: |
  - For 10 mM final fatty acid concentration, use approximately 5 mg of palmitic acid
  - Can be adapted for oleic acid or arachidonic acid by substituting the appropriate fatty acid
  - The 150 mM NaCl solution is prepared by diluting 60 μL of 5 M NaCl with 1940 μL water
  - Expected molar ratio is approximately 2:1 (fatty acid to BSA)
  - This small-scale protocol (2 mL) is designed for experimental optimization and can be scaled up as needed
  - BSA-FA complexes are most stable when stored at -20°C but can be stored at 4°C for up to 1 week
  - Solution pH should be approximately 7.4; adjust with NaOH if needed
