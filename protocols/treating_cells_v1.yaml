# Materials required
materials:
  - name: Culture plate
    type: 96-well, 24-well, or 6-well
    preparation: Cells at appropriate confluence for treatment
  - name: Control media
    temperature: Pre-warmed to 37°C
    storage: 4°C
  - name: Treatment media
    temperature: Pre-warmed to 37°C
    storage: As appropriate for treatment compound
  - name: PBS
    temperature: Room temperature or 37°C
    use: Optional for washing (compound-dependent)

# Equipment required
equipment:
  - name: Thermal bead bath
    temperature: 37°C
    use: For warming media
  - name: Biosafety cabinet
    certification: Class II
  - name: Aspirator
    type: Vacuum or manual
  - name: Pipettes and sterile tips
    range: Appropriate for plate format
  - name: CO2 incubator

# Protocol steps
steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Prepare treatment media"
    details: "Prepare fresh treatment media with the compound of interest at desired concentration"
  - step: 2
    action: "Pre-warm media"
    details: "Place control and treatment media in thermal bead bath at 37°C for at least 15 minutes"
  - step: 3
    action: "Remove plate from incubator"
    details: "Transfer cell culture plate to biosafety cabinet"
  - step: 4
    action: "Aspirate old media"
    details: "Carefully remove all existing media from wells without disrupting cell layer"
  - step: 5
    action: "Optional wash step"
    details: "If needed, gently wash cells with PBS to remove residual media/serum"
  - step: 6
    action: "Add appropriate volume of media"
    details: "Add pre-warmed control or treatment media according to plate format:
              - 150 μL for 96-well plates
              - 1 mL for 24-well plates
              - 2 mL for 6-well plates"
  - step: 7
    action: "Return to incubator"
    details: "Place plate back in incubator for the duration of the treatment period"
  - step: 8
    action: "Document treatment"
    details: "Record treatment start time, concentration, and other relevant details in lab notebook"

# Volume reference
volume_reference:
  - plate_type: "96-well"
    media_volume: "100-200 μL (typically 150 μL)"
  - plate_type: "48-well"
    media_volume: "250-500 μL"
  - plate_type: "24-well"
    media_volume: "0.5-1.0 mL"
  - plate_type: "12-well"
    media_volume: "1.0-1.5 mL"
  - plate_type: "6-well"
    media_volume: "1.5-3.0 mL (typically 2 mL)"
  - plate_type: "10 cm dish"
    media_volume: "8-12 mL"

# Critical parameters
critical_parameters:
  - parameter: "Media temperature"
    details: "Cold media can shock cells; ensure proper warming to 37°C"
  - parameter: "Treatment timing"
    details: "Maintain consistent timing between wells to ensure comparable exposure times"
  - parameter: "Media volume"
    details: "Insufficient volume can lead to drying; excessive volume may dilute treatment effect"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Cell death after treatment"
    solution: "Reduce treatment concentration; check solvent toxicity; verify media pH"
  - problem: "No treatment effect"
    solution: "Increase concentration or duration; verify compound stability; check for interference from media components"
  - problem: "Uneven treatment effects"
    details: "Ensure even distribution of treatment; mix gently if needed; check for edge effects"

# Safety considerations
safety:
  ppe: "Lab coat, gloves, and eye protection required"
  hazards: "Follow appropriate handling procedures for treatment compounds (check MSDS)"
  waste: "Dispose of treatment media according to institutional guidelines"

# Quality control
quality_control:
  - check: "Vehicle control"
    criteria: "Include wells with vehicle-only (solvent) treatment"
  - check: "Positive control"
    criteria: "If available, include wells with known effective compound"
  - check: "Treatment timing"
    criteria: "Record exact timing of treatment addition for accuracy"

# References
references:
  - "Cell culture media manufacturer's recommendations"
  - "Primary literature for specific treatments or compounds"

# Notes
notes: |
  - Ensure media is warmed to appropriate temperature before adding to cells
  - Media volume should be adjusted according to the plate format
  - Duration of treatment will depend on the specific experiment
  - For long-term treatments (>24 hours), consider refreshing treatment media
  - Some treatments may require serum starvation prior to administration
  - Document lot numbers of treatment compounds for reproducibility
  - For volatile or light-sensitive compounds, take appropriate precautions
