# Notes
notes: |
  - If proceeding directly to extraction, see RNA MiniPrep with DirectZol kit protocol
  - Volumes should be adjusted based on well size (96-well or 24-well format)
  - Always work in the fume hood when handling TRI reagent/TRIzol
  - RNA can be stored at -80°C for months to years without significant degradation
  - For cells growing in suspension, centrifuge cells first before adding TRI reagent
  - For highly confluent wells, increase the volume of TRI reagent accordingly
  - Homogenize samples by pipetting up and down if cell clumps are visible
  - For long-term storage, consider using RNA stabilization reagents like RNAlater
