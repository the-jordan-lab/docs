description: Protocol for measuring mRNA stability of target genes after Ybx1 knockdown using siRNA transfection and actinomycin D transcription inhibition
author: Dr. Jim Jordan
created: 2025-05-06
materials:
  - Material: siRNA targeting Ybx1 (final 10 nM)
  - Material: siRNA negative control (final 10 nM)
  - Material: Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (1.5 µL per well)
  - Material: Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium (as required)
  - Material: 6-well cell culture plates
  - Material: Actinomycin D (5 µg/mL final concentration)
  - Material: TRIzol reagent for RNA extraction
  - Material: SuperScript III Reverse Transcription kit
  - Material: qPCR primers for target genes
  - Material: SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix
steps:
  - "Day 1: Seed cells in 6-well plates at 3 × 10^5 cells per well in complete media."
  - "Day 2: Transfect cells with siRNA targeting Ybx1 or negative control siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to manufacturer's protocol."
  - "Day 3: Verify Ybx1 knockdown efficiency by collecting a subset of cells and performing RT-qPCR or western blot."
  - "Day 4: 
     a. Collect first time point (t=0) samples by extracting RNA with TRIzol.
     b. Add actinomycin D to remaining wells at 5 µg/mL final concentration.
     c. Collect RNA samples at 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, and 8h after actinomycin D addition."
  - "Day 5-6: 
     a. Perform RNA isolation from all collected samples.
     b. Synthesize cDNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcription kit with random hexamers and oligo-dT primers.
     c. Perform qPCR for target genes and reference genes.
     d. Calculate mRNA half-life by plotting relative mRNA levels on a semi-log scale versus time and determining the slope."
notes: |
  - For optimal results, verify Ybx1 knockdown efficiency before proceeding with actinomycin D treatment.
  - Use 18S rRNA or GAPDH as reference genes for normalization.
  - Target genes should include those known to be regulated post-transcriptionally, particularly those with m5C or m6A modifications.
  - The optimal actinomycin D concentration may vary by cell type; preliminary testing is recommended.
  - Actinomycin D is toxic; handle with care and dispose of properly.
  - For very stable mRNAs, time points may need to be extended beyond 8h.
