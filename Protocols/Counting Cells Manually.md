## Counting Cells Manually Protocol
## General Steps

1. After harvesting cells with Trypsin, mix cell suspension well.
2. Transfer 10–20 µl of the cell suspension into a microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add an equal volume of Trypan Blue solution.
4. Load 10 µl of mixture into a hemocytometer chamber.
5. Count live (unstained) vs dead (blue-stained) cells under a microscope.
6. Calculate total viable cells based on grid counts.
