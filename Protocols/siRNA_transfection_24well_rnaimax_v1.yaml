version: 1.0
description: Protocol for transfecting 4 siRNAs (including siNC) into cells in a 24-well plate using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX.
author: Lab Agent
created: 2024-06-08
materials:
  - siRNA: siRNA#1 (final 10 nM)
  - siRNA: siRNA#2 (final 10 nM)
  - siRNA: siRNA#3 (final 10 nM)
  - siRNA: siNC (negative control, final 10 nM)
  - Lipofectamine RNAiMAX: 1.5 µL per well
  - Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium: as required
  - Cells: seeded in 24-well plate (e.g., 5x10^4 cells/well)
steps:
  - "Seed cells in 24-well plate 24 hours prior to transfection (e.g., 5x10^4 cells/well)."
  - "For each siRNA, dilute 10 pmol siRNA in 50 µL Opti-MEM per well."
  - "In a separate tube, dilute 1.5 µL RNAiMAX in 50 µL Opti-MEM per well."
  - "Combine diluted siRNA and RNAiMAX, mix gently, and incubate for 10-20 min at room temperature."
  - "Add 100 µL siRNA-RNAiMAX complex dropwise to each well containing cells in 400 µL growth medium."
  - "Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24-72 hours."
notes: |
  - siNC is a non-targeting negative control siRNA.
  - Adjust cell number and reagent volumes as needed for specific cell lines.
  - Refer to manufacturer's instructions for further optimization.
