description: Protocol for measuring mRNA stability using siNC vs. siYbx1 with Actinomycin D treatment
author: Jordan Lab
created: 2025-05-06
materials:
  - Actinomycin D
  - DMSO (control)
  - Complete medium
  - PBS (ice-cold)
  - TRIzol or RLT buffer
  - Multi-channel pipette
  - Cell culture plates
  - Tubes for sample storage
steps:
  - "Prepare Actinomycin D and control media"
  - "Treat cells with ActD or control media"
  - "Collect time-point samples (0hr and subsequent)"
  - "Process samples for RNA extraction"
notes: |
  This protocol compares mRNA stability between control (siNC) and Ybx1 knockdown (siYbx1) conditions
  ActD concentration is 5 µg/mL
  Use multichannel pipettes to minimize time between treatments

#Protocol 
## (siNC vs. siYbx1 with Actinomycin D)
### ✅ Step 1: Actinomycin D Medium Preparation

(Just before treatment)

- Prepare 5 µg/mL ActD medium and DMSO-only control medium.  
      
    

Volumes needed:

- ActD (5 µg/mL): ~20 mL total (for all ActD wells)  
      
    
- No ActD (DMSO control): ~5 mL total

### ✅ Step 2: ActD Treatment and Initial Collection (0 hr)

Procedure:

- Remove old media quickly from the plate (multi-channel vacuum aspirator recommended).
    
- Using a multichannel pipet, rapidly add 100 µL of treatment media (ActD or No ActD) according to the plate map.
    
- Immediately collect the 0 hr samples.
    

- Cell Collection Protocol (all time points):
    

- Quickly aspirate medium.
    
- Briefly wash with 100 µL ice-cold PBS (optional).
    
- Lyse directly in wells using 50 µL TRIzol or RLT buffer.
    
- Transfer lysate immediately to labeled tubes/plate and store at –80°C.
    
- Repeat for each timepoint
    

Multichannel tip:

Aspirate and dispense solutions one column at a time to minimize delays.
