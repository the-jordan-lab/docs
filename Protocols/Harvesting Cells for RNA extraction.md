#Protocol 

Prepare cell collection tubes

Rack n 1.5-ml Eppie tubes and label 1-n

Prepare sample storage box [-80Â°C Sample Storage Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1n-TcSMLcNtWcNixfK7yqhQJJVVBpL1TQaZaernbRFhM/edit)


Remove cells from incubator

In laminar flow hood, aspirate media.

Wash cells

Add 200 ul (96-well) or 1 ml (24-well) PBS per well.

Aspirate until dry

In the fume hood, add 100 ul (for 96-well plates) or 300 ul (for 24-well plates) TRI reagent (or TRIzol) to each well.

Incubate at RT for 5 minutes.

Tilt plate back slightly to allow TRI reagents and cells to pool in the corner and pipet all of the solution into prelabeled tubes.

  

If not proceeding directly to extraction:

Place tubes in labeled box

Place labeled box in defined location

Freeze tubes at -80C and submit a [-80C Sample Submission](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Oox80CP6oEVm3IVtkPSENpUCua0RylQz3HFP5BZhjxw) form.
